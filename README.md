## Responsive Portfolio

This project is a Responsive Portfolio site for myself. It features an About Me page, a Portfolio page, and a Contact page. As it is responsive, the site's layout changes per the device screen's width. It should look as great on a small screen as it does on a large screen. Please refer to Assets/WebsiteScreenshots for screenshots taken of the site at 400px, 768px, and 992px.
